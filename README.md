# Rock vs Mine Prediction using SONAR Data

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on SONAR data. This is a binary classification task where we leverage a Logistic Regression model to make predictions. Such models are crucial in applications like naval defense, underwater exploration, and maritime safety.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Develop a machine learning model using SONAR data.
- Classify objects as "Rock" or "Mine".
- Explore and analyze the dataset for patterns and trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available SONAR dataset containing:
- **Features**: 60 numerical attributes representing energy levels of SONAR signals.
- **Labels**:
  - `R` for Rock
  - `M` for Mine

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocessed to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required for this project:
- Python (3.x)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Implementation Steps
1. **Import Dependencies**:
   - Load necessary libraries.
2. **Load Dataset**:
   - Load SONAR data into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Inspect the dataset (shape, descriptive statistics, class distribution).
   - Visualize key patterns (if applicable).
4. **Preprocessing**:
   - Encode class labels (`R` and `M`) into numerical values.
   - Split data into training and test sets.
5. **Model Development**:
   - Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
   - Predict labels for the test data.
6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Measure performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance:
- **Accuracy**: *[Insert Accuracy]*
- **Precision**: *[Insert Precision]*
- **Recall**: *[Insert Recall]*
- **F1-Score**: *[Insert F1-Score]*

## Potential Improvements
To enhance the project:
- Use advanced models like Random Forest or SVM for comparison.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
- Deploy the model as a web API or interactive application using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.
- Handle real-world noise by adding simulated variations to the dataset.

## Usage
Run the following command to execute the project:
```bash
python rock_vs_mine_prediction.py
```

Or open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Rock_vs_Mine_prediction.ipynb`) for an interactive walkthrough.
